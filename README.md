# Modern Controlling
Modern Controlling is a mod to improve the control of vanilla.
At present, it can:
- Use a new control settings screen, similar to what Mojang did in 21w37a. (Core)
- Better keybinding settings screen. <del>Similar to [Controlling](https://modrinth.com/mod/controlling).</del> (Keybind)
- Export your keybinding settings as a file (or import). (Keybind)
- When ANY key is pressed, all key bindings for this key can be activated. (Default disabled) (Toolkit)
- And more!

This mod is modular and can be added as required.
- Core: The foundation of other modules.
- Keybind: A better keybinding settings screen and key position files.
- Toolkit: Some small functions.

## Note:
- It is recommended to turn on "Force Unicode Font" in language settings to better use this mod.
- You ***CAN*** use this mod in your modpack.
